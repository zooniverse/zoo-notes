# What this app does

An app to view the publicly available extracts and reductions for a subjects. This app is intended to be used in a 'classroom' setting where students actively classify on a project workflow, the results of which are captured in this app to display the extracted data from each student and the reduced data to show how  aggregation works.

## System Architecture

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app relies on the pusher stream to listen to actively classified subjects for a known workflow. These subjects are collated and stored in browser local storage to provide a selection of subjects to investigate to show the extracts and reduced answer in the classroom. This local state can be cleared to reset the app for a new 'classroom'.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by Github Action. Both staging and production deployment can be run ad hoc in the actions tab as needed if you have the appropriate permissions on the repository.

###  Staging

This app does not have a staging deployment.

### Production

Production deployments are triggered by an update to which commit the `production-release` tag is pointed to. This tag should be updated via chat ops and then a Github Action will run that builds and uploads the files to our cloud provider found at `https://zoo-notes.zooniverse.org/`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
