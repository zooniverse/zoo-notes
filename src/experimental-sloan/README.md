## SLOAN Grant Experiments

This folder contains experimental components for the SLOAN Grant.

**What:** these components are "Cluster Viewers", able to view an astronomical
Subject in the context of the cluster of similar astronomical objects that it
exists in.

**Why:** we're grafting these experiments onto Zoo Notes because it's easier to
do so than to spin up a new repo and website. We fully intend to transfer any
successful experiments to a new home.

**When:** this experiment was started on Feb 2022 and should be removed within a
few months.
